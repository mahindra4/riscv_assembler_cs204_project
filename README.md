# riscv_assembler_cs204_project


This project implements a custom assembler for the RISC-V instruction set architecture, capable of converting RISC-V assembly code into machine code.

## Features

- Supports a subset of RISC-V instructions including:
  - Arithmetic operations
  - Logical operations
  - Load/store instructions
  - Branch and jump instructions
- Implements essential assembler directives
- Handles various instruction formats (R-type, I-type, S-type, etc.)
- Resolves labels and addressing
- Provides error handling and reporting
